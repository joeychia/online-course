## Active Decisions

### Technical Decisions
1. Performance Optimization
   - Implement lazy loading for unit lessons
   - Load lesson details only when unit expanded
   - Cache loaded unit data in memory
   - Simple and efficient loading pattern

2. Data Structure
   - Store minimal unit data in course document
   - Keep lesson data in unit documents
   - Load lessons on demand
   - Natural user interaction flow

3. Testing Strategy
   - Add performance benchmarks
   - Test with large datasets
   - Measure loading improvements

### UX Decisions
1. Admin Interface
   - Show loading state when expanding units
   - Load lessons only when needed
   - Clear user feedback during loading
   - Maintain mobile-first responsive design

2. Navigation
   - Progressive lesson unlocking
   - Course preview access
   - Note-taking requirements

3. Multi-language Support
   - Language selection UI
   - Content translation approach
   - Default language handling
