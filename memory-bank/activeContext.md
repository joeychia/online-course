   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Improved testability and maintainability

2. Performance Optimization
   - Smart caching in UnitDataAccess
   - Lazy loading for unit lessons
   - Load lesson details on demand
   - Efficient data patterns

3. Data Structure
   - Minimal course data with unit references
   - Complete unit data in separate documents
   - Cached unit data with TTL
   - Clear data flow through layers

3. Testing Strategy
   - Add performance benchmarks
   - Test with large datasets
   - Measure loading improvements

### UX Decisions
1. Admin Interface
   - Show loading state when expanding units
   - Load lessons only when needed
   - Clear user feedback during loading
   - Maintain mobile-first responsive design

2. Navigation
   - Progressive lesson unlocking
   - Course preview access
   - Note-taking requirements

3. Multi-language Support
   - Language selection UI
   - Content translation approach
   - Default language handling

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. Testing Updates
   - Update test suite for new architecture
   - Add tests for data access layer
   - Verify caching behavior
   - Test error handling

### Future Considerations
1. Course Upload Enhancement
   - Implement UI-based batch course upload
   - Replace manual script-based upload
   - Add progress tracking for large uploads
   - Consider chunked upload for large courses

2. User & Group Management
   - User management features
   - Group assignment system
   - Access control refinement
