  - Implementation details:
    * Created flexible CourseCard component with configurable actions
    * Used translation system for button text
    * Updated tests to select buttons by position rather than text
    * Fixed TypeScript errors and unused imports

- Order Field Removal:
  - Removed order fields from all data structures:
    * CourseUnit interface
    * Unit interface
    * UnitLesson interface
    * Lesson interface
  - Benefits:
    * Simplified data model
    * Reduced data redundancy
    * Natural array-based ordering
    * Smaller database documents
  - Implementation:
    * Updated firestoreService to not use order fields
    * Modified unit/lesson operations to use array indices
    * Updated all tests to reflect new data structure
    * Verified all functionality works correctly
  - Testing:
    * All tests passing with new array-based ordering
    * Confirmed reordering functionality works
    * Verified data consistency

- Service Layer Consolidation:
  - Removed dataService.ts and associated data access files
  - Merged all functionality into firestoreService.ts
  - Benefits:
    * Simplified service layer architecture
    * Single source of truth for data operations
    * Clearer data flow
    * Reduced code complexity
  - Testing:
    * Updated all tests to use firestoreService
